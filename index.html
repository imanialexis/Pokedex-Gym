        <p>The Celadon Gym (Japanese: タマムシジム Tamamushi Gym) is the official Gym of Celadon City. It is based on Grass-type Pokémon.
            The Gym Leader is Erika. Trainers who defeat her receive the Rainbow Badge.In all versions and adaptations of
            Pokémon, Celadon Gym is consistently rendered as a greenhouse. In the games, the Celadon Gym is a garden full
            of Trainers, all of which are female except Ben. It is impossible to reach Erika without fighting at least two
            other Trainers and using Cut. In Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, the Gym consists of lanes lined with flower
            pots and flower-covered archways that form a maze.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Celadon Gym appeared in Pokémon Scent-sation!. Ash wanted to challenge Erika to a Gym battle, but the workers at the
            Gym refused to allow his entry because he had earlier criticized a perfume shop, saying that all they do is turn
            men into zombies. They kicked him out of the shop for insulting them. When Ash found out that the Gym is where
            the perfume was manufactured, he was visibly shocked. With help from Team Rocket, Ash, in the guise of "Ashley,"
            gained entry into the Gym. However, Pikachu recognized that it was him, and ThunderShocked him to reveal Ash
            to everyone in the Gym. After challenging Erika, she accepted his challenge, saying it's against Pokémon League
            rules to refuse a challenge. Their battle was short-lived due to Team Rocket stealing the perfume. They detonated
            several bombs for their getaway, setting the Gym ablaze. However, thanks to the Pokémon of Ash, Misty and Brock,
            the Gym survived. After the fire was put out, Erika gave Ash the Rainbow Badge as a thanks for saving her Gloom
            from the flames.
